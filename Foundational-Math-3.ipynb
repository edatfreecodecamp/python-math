        "Writing code for scientific notation, you will make use of logarithms with base 10. Remember that scientific notation is in the form n $*$ 10<sup>x</sup> where `n` is one digit and then a decimal. To convert a number to scientific notation, take the log of the number and use the `floor()` function to get the expoenent (just as you did in a previous step). Divide the original number by 10 to that exponent and you get `n` (hint: dividing by 10<sup>x</sup> is the same as multiplying by 10<sup>-x</sup>). Rounding is usually necessary. Write the code to convert numbers to scientific notation."

Like any pair of inverse functions, the line y = e<sup>x</sup> and the line y = ln(x) are mirrored over the line y = x.  Because of the `np.linspace()` function in this code, `np.log()` works, but `math.log()` does not work here. Both log() functions in Python use e as the base by default. When using the `numpy` library, use `np.log10()` for base 10, `np.log2()` for base 2, etc. Because log functions can only have positive x values, the np.linspace() function will define a positive range for the log() function. Run this code, then change the blue line function to graph y = 2<sup>x</sup> and change the green line function to graph y = log<sub>2</sub>x and notice the similarities between the graphs."

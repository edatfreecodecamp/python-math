        "To convert a decimal number to a fraction, let $x$ = the number of decimal places. The basic fraction is the number (without the decimal point) over 10$^{x}$. Example: 0.2 = $\\frac{2}{10}$ and 0.34 = $\\frac{34}{100}$ and 0.567 = $\\frac{567}{1000}$. In some cases, you may be able to reduce that fraction. Because \"percent\" means \"out of 100\" the percent refers to the first two decimal places. Complete the code to ask for a decimal input, then print the fraction and the percent. Hint: The `exponent` variable gives you the number of decimal places."
